# Relentless
Relentless is an app helps the users achieve their goals using three principals: clarity, hyperfocus, and discipline.

## Relentless Summary
The app asks the user to define annual goals and set micro-goals underneath each annual pillar (both monthly and weekly).
The user can then track progress by marking the weekly, monthly, annual goals that have been completed.
A summary of the progress is provided to the user in a dashboard in the user page.
